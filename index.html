        <p> <img id="caseypic" src="assets/images/caseypic.jpg" alt="Picture"> Elegant? Check. Charming? You betcha.
            Intelligent? Why of course, my dear watson. Graceful?
            Like a swan. Assertive? Darn tootin. Hyper-inflated sense of self-worth steming from a plethora of mediocre
            acheivements? Quite possibly This is what makes the man,
            the myth, the legend, Casey Clingaman <br>
            <br> Forged in the misty streets of the Pacific Northwest, there exists no greater asset
            to your computer-engineering team than the accomplished programmer you see before you today on this page. .
            . . Okay, maybe
            there are a few. But still, I am a formidable candidate. Whatever I lack in technical skills, work ethic or
            even basic common sense is more than made up for with my impeccible wit
            and winning personality. <br>
            <br>I have desinged this webpage to display my skills as an engineer and further blossoming portfolio. The
            skills I have obtained through life and sharpened with the
            University of Washington Coding Bootcamp have sculpted me into a truly valuable employee and fellow
            coworker. Given the opportunity, I will shine like a freshly polished diamond and glisten
            with success, bolstering whichever company has the privilege of employing me. Casey is comes from the latin
            word "Casieus" which translates literally to mean "wonderful fortune". I am living proof
            of this definition. I am a golden god. I am Casey Clingaman. </p>
